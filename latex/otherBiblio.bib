@article{todorov2004,
	Abstract = {The sensorimotor system is a product of evolution, development, learning
	and adaptationwhich work on different time scales to improve behavioral
	performance. Consequently, many theories of motor function are based
	on optimal performance: they quantify task goals as cost functions,
	and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain
	detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not
	without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than
	any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired
	movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work
	has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused
	on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has
	allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations
	into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting
	motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship
	between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control
	strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},
